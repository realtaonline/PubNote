This directory contains [Noto fonts](https://www.google.com/get/noto/), used to ensure reliable display of multilingual text in <PubNote> outputs.

These fonts are included in this repository under the terms of the [Open Font License (OFL)](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL), which allows free use, distribution, and embedding in documents and applications, including open-source projects like this one.

### Why "Noto"?

The name *Noto* comes from *No tofu* — a reference to the white square □ ("tofu") that appears when a font doesn't support a character. The goal of Noto is to support all Unicode characters so no tofu ever appears.

### Why use Noto?

The Noto typefaces were developed by Google in collaboration with international experts, offering high-quality typography with consistent design across writing systems. They provide exceptional coverage of Unicode characters, making them ideal for scientific publishing and multilingual content.

Noto is also a guilt-free resource — it’s openly licensed, responsibly maintained, and safe to include in public repositories and commercial or non-commercial projects alike.
