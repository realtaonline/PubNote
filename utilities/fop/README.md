# fop

These files are not part of the Apache FOP distribution, but have been created as part of this project in order to utlize the tool.

This provides a consistent home for FOP invocations, separate from the FOP distribution directory itself, thus allowing the FOP distribution directory to be replaced entirely with an updated release.
