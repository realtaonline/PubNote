# Security Policy

## Current Status

At this time, there are no known security vulnerabilities in the \<PubNote> tools.

All software in this repository is sourced from well-known open-source projects. While this does not guarantee security, it does allow for broad community review and transparency, which we consider promising.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a potential security issue, please report it privately via email to [github@RealtaOnline.com](mailtogithub@RealtaOnline.com) rather than opening a public issue. Responsible disclosure gives us the opportunity to assess and address the issue before public discussion.

If warranted, we will acknowledge the issue, investigate promptly, and provide updates in the repository when resolved.

## Scope

This policy applies only to code and configuration files in this repository. It does not extend to upstream open-source dependencies or third-party tools used during processing.
