# shell

This directory contains scripts for Unix-style command-line environments, such as found on macOS or Linux.

These `.sh` files automate common tasks, such as validating your XML, translating label text, or generating reports. If you're comfortable running Terminal commands, this is the most direct way to work with <PubNote>.

The shell scripts are the working engine behind the drag-and-drop Mac apps.
