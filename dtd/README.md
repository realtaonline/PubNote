# dtd

This directory contains the official PubMed XML DTD (Document Type Definition) files.

These files define the structure of the XML documents used by PubMed. If you’re working with the original PubMed XML (the same format used for submission or distribution), these files are the technical backbone that explain what’s allowed where.

They are copied from the offociation locations for the [DTD for submission](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3828/#publisherhelp.PubMed_XML_Tagged_Format) and for the [DTD for distribution](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/download/#documentation).

You don’t need to change or write DTDs — they’re included here for reference and for creating the RELAX-NG (RNG) versions for validation.
