# Roadmap

Phase 1 is considered completed and is presentation-oriented only, displaying the XML content in a way to make the user's job of reviewing it easier. Nevertheless, improvements and additions to the label language translations for [xsl/xlate/](xsl/xlate/) are most welcome at any time. It would be good to support more natural languages in the metadata labels.

Phase 2 of the project development will proceed when end-user requirements are gathered, and when the Phase 1 visualization and validation resources get more visibility.

Phase 2 is expected to be focused on drafting PubMed submission documents from user input and/or external JATS article XML documents. 

Some thoughts for Phase 2:
 - can a simple text format interpreted by iXML be used to help non-XML'ers compose draft submission documents without using angle brackets?
 - can a user enumerate a list of JATS article XML documents to be scraped for content relative to a draft submission document?
