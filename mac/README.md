# mac

This directory contains small Mac applications that make it easier to run the \<PubNote> tools without needing to open a Terminal window.

If you're using a Mac, you can drag and drop your PubMed XML files onto these apps. Each one is tailored for a specific task, like checking for errors or transforming content.

No command-line knowledge is needed to use these apps

***Note: These apps will not function correctly if this repository is downloaded as a ZIP file. Mac applications require certain hidden file structures that ZIP archives do not preserve. To ensure these apps work as intended, you must clone or fork the repository using a GitHub account rather than downloading it as a ZIP. Instructions for doing this are provided in the main [README file](../README.md)..***
