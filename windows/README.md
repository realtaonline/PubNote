# windows

This directory contains Windows batch files (.bat) that let you run \<PubNote> tools by drag-and-drop or from the DOS command line.

Each batch file is tailored for a specific function, such as validation or formatting. They're built to be easy to use, especially for those unfamiliar with XML or scripting.

Windows drag-and-drop should work as expected, regardless of how you copy the repository, though some users report problems after installing the ZIP on a networked drive. This hasn't been reported after cloning or forking the repository on a networked drive.
