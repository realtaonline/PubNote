# rng

In this directory are the [RELAX-NG (RNG)](https://relaxng.org/) versions of the PubMed in (submission) and out (distribution) DTDs.

These files were created from the PubMed DTDs using [Trang](https://relaxng.org/jclark/trang.html).

The Jing utility gives better XML validation feedback to users than available free tools using DTD document models, but it works only with RNG document models, hence the need for these translations.
