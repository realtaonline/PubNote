# dev

This directory contains developer tools for regression testing and for managing the repository itself.

In particular, `preRepository.sh` walks through the steps to make sure the repository is polished before merging into the main branch.

The scripts and tools here help keep the structure tidy, reset local files to match the repository, and prepare things for sharing with others. You don’t need to use these unless you’re planning to contribute or tinker with how the repository is built and maintained.

Collaborators are welcome to make pull requests with tools suggested for consideration.
