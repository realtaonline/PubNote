# test

This directory contains example PubMed XML files you can use for testing or demonstration.

They help illustrate how \<PubNote> works and provide a safe source of anonymized content to experiment before applying any transformations to your own content.

If you're learning by doing, this is a good place to start.

***Note, however, you need to copy these files out of this directory into one of your own directories so that any resulting files are not considered additions to the git repository.***
